# Real-time-forum

The instructions for this task were to create an improved forum using JS, with private messages and real time actions.

# Usage

To run the program at the default 8080 port, use `go run .`

If you wish to use a different port, you can add a valid port number as an argument.

Ex. `go run . 5000`

# Instructions

In order to use the forum, you will need an account. After creating an account you can log in and start testing.

To see the exact time a private message was sent, you can hover over it.

# Testing

[Here](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/real-time-forum/audit) are the audit questions to test the program.

If there are any issues, feel free to contact me on discord.
